| Tool        | Reliability                                                                                                                               | Ease of use                                                                                |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cypress     | Handles some cases with implicit waits.(Element to be actionable)                                                                         | Has APIs to [wait for requests](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait.html#Syntax) other waits to be handled using promises                              |
| Puppeteer   | Handles some cases with implicit waits.(Page loads on goto navigation)                                                                    | Has APIs to [wait for navigation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.18.0/docs/api.md#pagewaitfornavigationoptions) and [wait for some predicates](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.18.0/docs/api.md#pagewaitforselectororfunctionortimeout-options-args). |
| Selenium    | All waits has to be handled by user.                                                                                                      | Has APIs to [wait for conditions](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_WebDriver.html#wait)                                            |
| Taiko       | Handles most cases with implicit waits.(Element visibility, page loads, xhrs, new tab/window open or close)                               | Most waits handled implicitly. Has good fallback options to waits explicitly in code using wait for events and [waitFor](https://taiko.gauge.org/#waitfor) api.           |
| Testcafe    | Handles most cases with [implicit waits](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/test-api/built-in-waiting-mechanisms.html).  | Most waits handled implicitly. Fallback is not very extensive, can only wait for some time.                             |
| WebdriverIO | All waits has to be handled by user.                                                                                                      | Has APIs to wait for element displayed, exits and enabled. Also [`waitUntil`](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/waitUntil.html) that takes a predicate to waitFor.                        |
